# Linear-Regression (An overview of Linear and Multiple Regression)

This project aims to comprehensively demonstrate the use of Linear Regression in RStudio and Python. 

In mathematics, regression is a statistical technique employed when considering the relationship between dependent and independent variables. This process determines if the changes in the dependent variables are connected with any of the independent variables.

One of the most commonly used regression algorithms is Linear Regression. In simple terms, this is a linear (arranged along a straight line) approach for relationship modeling between two variables. The variables are always dependent and independent. It is important to note that the order of the variables matters. The independent variable belongs on the x-axis, while the dependent variable belongs on the y-axis.
